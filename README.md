# Library-Builder-
This Javascript program carries three different types of media: books and movies. 

In this project I created a parent class named Media with three subclasses: Book and Movie.

Each subclass is able to extract the average rating by passing a value through the function. 

This lets you input any vlaue to store in your library.
